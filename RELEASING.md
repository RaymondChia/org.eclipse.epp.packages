The EPP Release Process
=======================

An online editable version of this document is on [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/@jonahgraham/eclipse-epp-release-process), updates should be copied to [Eclipse's git repo](https://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.packages.git/tree/RELEASING.md). The Eclipse version is the official one.

This guide contains the step-by-step process to complete an EPP release. 

EPP releases happen for each milestone and release candidate according to the [Eclipse Simultaneous Release Plan](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Simultaneous_Release).

Steps for Milestones and RCs:

- [ ] Ensure that the [CI build](https://ci.eclipse.org/packaging/job/simrel.epp-tycho-build/) is green. Resolving non-green builds will require tracking down problems and incompatibilities across all Eclipse participating projects. [cross-project-issues-dev](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/cross-project-issues-dev) mailing list is a good place to start when tracking such problems.
- [ ] Update splash screen (once per release cycle, hopefully done before M1). See detailed [instructions](https://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.packages.git/tree/packages/org.eclipse.epp.package.common/splash/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
- [ ] Review packageMetaData packageName= and product name= entries in epp.website.xml to ensure consistency with regards to use of incubation, speficially packages containing incubating components must have:
    - [ ] `-incubation` at the end of the product name (e.g. `<product name="eclipse-cpp-2020-03-RC1-incubation" />`)
    - [ ] ` (includes Incubating components)` at the end of the packageMetaData packageName matching whitespace and letter case (e.g. `packageName="Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers (includes Incubating components)"`)
- [ ] Update name of the release in strings with a "smart" global find&replace. See this [gerrit](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/157267/) for an example. In particular, check:
    - [ ] `packages/*/epp.website.xml` for `product name=` line
    - [ ] Variables in parent pom `releng/org.eclipse.epp.config/parent/pom.xml`
    - [ ] On M1, whole version string is updated, including platform version (e.g. `4.14` -> `4.15`); this is a large change including pom.xml, feature.xml, MANIFEST.MF, epp.website.xml, and epp.product
- [ ] When the year changes, e.g. between 2019-12 and 2020-03 releases, an update of the copyright year is required with a very smart search&replace.
- [ ] Update the build qualifiers to ensure that packages are all updated. Run [setGitDate](https://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.packages.git/tree/releng/org.eclipse.epp.config/tools/setGitDate) script. This script will make a local commit.
- [ ] Wait for announcement that the staging repo is ready on [cross-project-issues-dev](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/cross-project-issues-dev). An [example announcement](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cross-project-issues-dev/msg17420.html).
- [ ] Run a [CI build](https://ci.eclipse.org/packaging/job/simrel.epp-tycho-build/) that includes the above changes
- [ ] Sanity check the build for the following:
    - [ ] Download a package from the build's artifacts `artifact/org.eclipse.epp.packages/archive/`
    - [ ] Made sure filenames contain expected build name and milestone, e.g. `2020-03-M2`
    - [ ] Splash screen says expected release name (with no milestone), e.g. 2020-03
    - [ ] Help -> About says expected build name and milestone, e.g. `2020-03-M2`
    - [ ] `org.eclipse.epp.package.*` features and bundles have the timestamp of the forced qualifier update or later
- [ ] Mark build as Keep forever
- [ ] Edit Build Information and name it (e.g. 2020-03 M3)
- [ ] Send email to epp-dev to request package maintainers test it.
- [ ] For a release build, the additional parameters (see parent pom) should be set in the Jenkins build job to a meaningful time/date:
```
maven.build.timestamp=20191212-1212
eclipse.simultaneous.release.build=20191212-1212
build=20191212-1212
```
- [ ] Run the [Promote a Build](https://ci.eclipse.org/packaging/job/promote-a-build/) CI job to prepare build artifacts and copy them to download.eclipse.org
    - [ ] Run the build once in `DRY_RUN` mode to ensure that the output is correct before it is copied to download.eclipse.org.
- [ ] **TO BE AUTOMATED**
    - [ ] **On M1-RC1 release day** approximately 9:30am :
        - [ ] copy the composite\*RC1.jar files over the composite\*.jar files in https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/packages/2020-03/
    - [ ] **On final release day** approximately 9:30am (TBD when should these operaions happen - it needs time to be mirrored still!) :
        - [ ] flatten the published RC2 (or respun RC2) P2 repository as https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/packages/2020-03/
        - [ ] rename the provisional release milestone to final directory (E.g. [2020-03/RC2](https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/downloads/release/2020-03/RC2) -> [2020-03/R](https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/downloads/release/2020-03/R)
    - [ ] When automated this can/should be triggered by the https://ci.eclipse.org/simrel/view/All/job/simrel.releng.makeVisible/ job - in the past this worked which meant that SimRel and EPP would synchronize their releases.
    - [ ] These are the expected commands that need to be automated on M2-RC1 release days.
    ```
    CHECKPOINT=RC1
    REPO_ROOT=/home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/packages
    rsync --group --verbose ${REPO_ROOT}/compositeArtifacts${CHECKPOINT}.jar ${REPO_ROOT}/compositeArtifacts.jar
    rsync --group --verbose ${REPO_ROOT}/compositeContent${CHECKPOINT}.jar ${REPO_ROOT}/compositeContent.jar
    ```

- [ ] The _next_ release sub-directory needs to be created immediately _after_ a release, i.e. when 2019-12 was released, a directory 2020-03 had been created with an empty p2 composite repository pointing to 2019-12 until M1. On M1 release day this changes to a composite p2 repository with M1 content. On other release days, add the new releases as children. 
- [ ] On release day, update [release.xml](https://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/downloads/release/release.xml) which basically lists the relative locations of past, present, and future package releases. This will allow the webmasters to publish the new packages on the main Eclipse download page.
